**Project Overview

This project implements a Flask web application where users can view and coompare the classification results of two machine learning models (Decision Tree and Logistic Regression) based on the Iris dataset. The app also visualizes the classifier accuracies and confusion matrices.

**Technologies Used
 **Python** 
 **Flask** for web framework
 **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)
 **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
 **Pandas** & **Numpy** for data manipulation
 **HTML/CSS** for front-end

**How to run the app**
Run the Flask app:
 python project1.py
 Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
 The page allows you to visualize the comparison between the classifiers and their confusion matrices.

**Results**
Once the app is running, the application will show:-
Accuracy % of the models.
Bar chart comparison.
Visualizations confusion matrices of both Decision Tree and Logistic Regression model.
